# CopperStuff
CopperStuff is my first mod which adds a few new uses for copper such as copper tools, copper armor, and copper nuggets.

I aimed to make copper fit between gold and iron, so it's about half as durable as iron.

If you have an suggestions or find any issues, please open an issue on the GitHub page or join my Discord server.

Notes:
- There is a `1.19_experimental_snapshot_1` version on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Puyodead1/CopperStuff/actions?query=branch%3Afabric-1.19_experimental_snapshot_1)
- I decided to discard a forge version as trying to maintain both would be chaos for me right now
- I was planning to add copper horse armor, but then I realized it's not easily obtainable and probably would be useless.
- I suck at art so the textures may look like trash, I did my best :P
- I'm open to feedback!
